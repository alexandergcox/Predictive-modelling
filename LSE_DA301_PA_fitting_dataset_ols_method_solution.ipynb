    "> - $R^2$: 65% of the total variability of `y` (money spent by customers), is explained by the variability of `X` (how long they have been a member).  \n",
    "> - F-stat: If the probability of F stat. is smaller than a threshold (usually 0.05), the set of variables of the regression model are significant, else, the regression is not good. For simple regression model, the `t`-statistic is equivalent.\n",
    "> - `X`: The coefficient of `X` describes the slope of the regression line, in other words, how much the response variable `y` change when `X` changes by 1 unit. In this activity, if the length that the customer has been a member (`X`) changes by 1 unit (please check units used) the money spent (`y`) will change by 64.2187 units. \n",
    ">  - The `t`-value tests the hypothesis that the slope is significant or not. If the corresponding probability is small (typically smaller than 0.05) the slope is significant. In this case, the probability of the t-value is zero, thus the estimated slope is significant. \n",
    ">   - The last two numbers describe the 95% confidence interval of the true xcoefficient, i.e. the true slope. For instance, if you take a different sample, the estimated slope will be slightly different. If you take 100 random samples each of 500 observations of `X` and `y`, then 95 out of the 100 samples will derive a slope that is within the interval (60.112 , 68.326).\n",
    ">   - In case of a multivariate regression model, each explanatory variable will have a separate row with the above information. So we will need to check which of the variables are significant, remove the ones that are not significant and then re-run the new regression model."
